This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library("vegan")
set.seed(36)
fake_data <- ceiling(data.frame("a" = rnorm(n=10, mean=2000, sd=1000),
                       "b" = runif(n=10, max=10000, min=4000),
                       "c" = rbinom(n=10, size=100, prob=0.1),
                       "d" = rnorm(n=10, mean=50000, sd = 10000)))

read_depth <- rowSums(fake_data)
read_depth
```

Now we get to the main question: what does vegan::rarefy() do?

Make some rarefication levels based on the counts in the table:
```{r}
median_depth <- stats::median(read_depth)
mean_depth <- ceiling(base::mean(read_depth))
max_depth <- base::max(read_depth)
min_depth <- base::min(read_depth)
print(paste("mean:", mean_depth, "median:", median_depth))

raref_levels <- seq(from = min_depth, to = max_depth, length.out = 4)
print("rarefaction levels")
print(raref_levels)
```

Now test out the rarefy function if we leave in the samples that are too low:
```{r}
for(s in 1:length(raref_levels)){
  seq_d <- raref_levels[s]#new read depth
  rd_filt_asv <- data.frame(vegan::rrarefy(fake_data, seq_d))#dataset 1 (read depth filtered asv)
  rd_filt_rowSums <- base::rowSums(rd_filt_asv)
  print(rd_filt_rowSums)
}
```

Testing out DESEQ2 
```{r}
libary("deseq2")

```
